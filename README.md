# Clustering_Prob
It is a unsupervised ML problem. In this problem, I have used a dataset which contains different different data of different countries. There are many features like Country, Region, Population, Climate, Birth Rate etc. I have tried to group the countries on basis of these features by using K-Means clustering algorithm. By using Elbow method, I have tried to find the numbers of clusters or groups.
